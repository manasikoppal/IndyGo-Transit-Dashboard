# IndyGo-Transit-Dashboard


The IndyGo Ridership Dashboard is an interactive visualization tool developed for IndyGo, the public transit agency in Indianapolis.It provides actionable insights into ridership patterns using historical and real-time data. The dashboard enables planners, policymakers, and the public to better understand how transit services are used, guiding smarter service planning, optimizing resources, and improving rider experience.


Our dashboard was built to answer the following key questions about IndyGo ridership:

1. What is the total ridership across different time scales (day, week, month, year)?

2. How does ridership vary across different route categories, such as high-frequency routes, rapid transit, and coverage services?

3. What are the ridership trends for specific routes over the past 12 months?

4. How do ridership levels change across different time frames, including monthly, by bid period, or over rolling five-week windows?

5. What are the changes in ridership over time, such as month-to-month, year-over-year, or week-to-week?

6. Which stops experience the highest and lowest ridership, and how can these insights inform resource allocation?
